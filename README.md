# PHP Education

This repository is keeping my PHP codes and folders. Also i want to say my customers and my employer 'I learned  PHP rules from zero to top '  with this repository meaning proof. 🐘

## Why PHP?
First of all, i was know basic of PHP but that time when i was second year of college, i just want to have fun and never thinking be professional because it was fast to learn to do anything and was feeling cool make any website in that years.

PHP have huge opportunity to get a job, remote work and also get internship. So i decided learn PHP again but like a professional.

I think we shouldn't look what is the best of programming language. I think we should advance the developer ability and learn to use multi technology in one project. So keep try! 🚀

### 1.Introduction

| Number | Subject            |
| ---    | ---                |
| 1      | Syntax             |
| 2      | Variables          |
| 3      | Data Types         |
| 4      | Constant Variables |
| 5      | Magic Quotes       |

#### 1. Syntax
use two type comment line with comment multi line and also print directly with PHP tags or echo.

#### 2. Variables
How to start to make PHP variables or not and what's the make a permission and not.

#### 3. Data Types
not need specify to type of variables but learned what's inside of PHP types.

#### 4. Constant Variables
using with define() function and have same syntax rule with variable.

#### 5. Magic Quotes
Can manipulate string and magic quotes provides flexibility .Generally use better to use (") instead of (')

### 2. Operators

| Number | Subject                     |
| ---    | ---                         |
| 1      | Arithmetic Operators        |
| 2      | Assignment Operators        |
| 3      | Increase Decrease Operators |
| 4      | Comparison Operators        |
| 5      | Logical Operators           |


#### 1. Arithmetic Operators
practiced math operations, child level. Important of brackets in operation priority.

#### 2. Assignment Operators
possible to make math operations before assign a value and also merge a value and merge a value before assign a value.

#### 3. Increase Decrease Operators
using like a assignment operators but not flexible. focusing same variable and only increase and decrease.

#### 4. Comparison Operators
check condition between variables. figure out make condition between same value but different type of variables.

#### 5. Logical Operators
difference between comparison operators and logical operators is comparison not looking math or variable types. check between true and false or true or false or is it false

### 3. Conditions

| Number | Subject            |
| ---    | ---                |
| 1      | If Else            |
| 2      | Switch Case        |
| 3      | Ternary            |
| 4      | Alternative Syntax |

#### 1. If Else
purpose is make whatever we want in right condition/conditions.

#### 2. Switch Case
working logic is same as before. Generally using in functions.

#### 3. Ternary
Ternary is my favorite. you can make if else condition in 1 line!

#### 4. Alternative Syntax
possible to use conditions without curly braces and also this is the best way to use PHP conditions in HTML

### 4. Arrays

| Number | Subject              |
| ---    | ---                  |
| 1      | Array Identification |
| 2      | Nested Array         |
| 3      | Constant Array       |

#### 1. Array Identification
array is saving us to use more variable if that variables sub element of anything.

#### 2. Nested Array
possible to use more than 2 arrays together in 1 array. It's clear and saving us more arrays.

#### 3. Constant Array
define() can make constant array like a constant variable. Same rule but different purpose

### 5. Loops

| Number | Subject      |
| ---    | ---          |
| 1      | For Loop     |
| 2      | Foreach Loop |
| 3      | While Loop   |
| 4      | Do-While     |

#### 1. For Loop
if we need to make operation in necessary range, this is the best way. Also can use alternative syntax like a conditions.

#### 2. Foreach Loop
if we don't need range and if we just want to do array operation, best way!

#### 3. While Loop
keep working while condition is true.

#### 4. Do-While
working once whatever condition. If condition true, keep working.

### 6. Functions

| Number | Subject                                  |
| ---    | ---                                      |
| 1      | Function Identification                  |
| 2      | Anonymous Functions                      |
| 3      | Sending Unlimited Parameters to Function |
| 4      | Recursive Functions                      |
| 5      | Function Exists Check                    |
| 6      | Generator Functions                      |
| 7      | Static Variable in Functions             |
| 8      | Return selected data type from Function  |


#### 1. Function Identification
if we don't want to write same code again and want to make regular, best way is this and also want to access a variable  in the function, we'll use global variable.

#### 2. Anonymous Functions
principally same with normal function. Difference between is anonymous function getting data or working rather than parameters. You don't need to code a new function just write and skip that and also you can use  "use" with functions and that's making get a variable or function in function(Line: 17, 50).

#### 3. Sending Unlimited Parameters to Function
till this lesson, i  was only know we should decide to how many parameters we send before create a function. But we can catch how many parameters we send and list all of parameters and print selected parameter in array.

#### 4. Recursive Functions
some arrays have more subarrays inside and we don't know how long takes. That's why it's not possible to write a foreach code for every situation. But it's possible to make by recursive functions.

#### 5. Function Exists Check
server will load php file before running and if function is not exists, it's will be problem so we have to check functions before using.

#### 6. Generator Functions
Maybe it's not necessary in simple projects but if you want to do big project(more than 1 million data) and don't want to face to face memory problem, please use "yield". 100 times more memory performance!

#### 7. Static Variable in Functions
if you call a function 2 times and if each calls make a operation, every operation gonna clear before operation. If you want to keep all of this, you need to use "static" variable.

#### 8. Return Selected Data Type from Function
It's not necessary but if you work together and have to put rules about data type, it's necessary.  This features of PHP 7 making possible to return selected data type and making strong with declare "strict_types = 1"

### 7. Defined Functions

| Number | Subject             |
| ---    | ---                 |
| 1      | Array Functions - 1 |
| 2      | Array Functions - 2 |
| 3      | Array Functions - 3 |
| 4      | String Functions    |
| 5      | prinf() Functions   |

#### 1. Array Functions - 1
some helpful functions for array operations. I already know much more but some of functions is necessary? I don't know. I wrote comment side of code if you're want to check.

#### 2. Array Functions - 2
in this functions, it's making amazing manipulate arrays like a filter, random, search, shift, pop etc.

#### 3. Array Functions - 3
easy to manipulate index position by these functions.

#### 4. String Functions
making manipulate and possible to getting info from string value

#### 5. prinf() Functions
making manipulate a string without assignment operations before print

### 8. Form

| Number | Subject               |
| ---    | ---                   |
| 1      | Simple Form           |
| 2      | POST Method           |
| 3      | GET  Method           |
| 4      | REQUEST Method        |
| 5      | Multiple FORM request |

#### 1. Simple Form
Create a simple form tools without CSS and what's difference between them

#### 2. POST Method
After simple form, i learned how to make post, how to check my post,  and how to make with secure my post also learned new function to make safe.

#### 3. GET Method
if i should say something about GET, this is not secure for private info and database operations. So we can use for "search" and maybe update operation with session check. But working principle is same by POST method.

#### 4. REQUEST Method
difference from GET and POST method is can do both of job by same command. If form method is GET, REQUEST method will do GET method, if it's POST, will be same result, is up to you.

#### 5. Multiple FORM request
separation of form post method is depend to hidden input. Line: 32-44

### 9. File and Directory Operations

| Number | Subject                          |
| ---    | ---                              |
| 1      | Call File [Include/Require]      |
| 2      | Create/Read/Delete File          |
| 3      | Create/Delete Directory          |
| 4      | Check Exists File/Directory      |
| 5      | CHMOD Config in File/Directory   |
| 6      | List Files in Directory          |
| 7      | Rename/Move File and Directory   |

#### 1. Call File [Include/Require]
what's the difference between include and require, if i should once include or require, exists components(header, footer) and merge in 1 file.

#### 2. Create/Read/Delete File
how to create, read and delete file.  how to make both of read and write and also check inside of file

#### 3. Create/Delete Directory
we can create folder with access permission for users and delete folder.

#### 4. Check Exists File/Directory
PHP getting error if you include not exists file. You're need to check file exists before include.

#### 5. CHMOD Config in File/Directory
CHMOD is so important for file security. Read/Write permission and execute config making by numbers between 0 and 7

#### 6. List Files in Directory
we are need to 2 function to list all of files. That functions can get filter parameter or handle it in first parameter by string. It's useful for include multiple files.

#### 7. Rename/Move File and Directory
possible to rename file and folder and also move file and folder only need 1 function

### 10. Session

| Number | Subject                            |
| ---    | ---                                |
| 1      | Start/Use/Delete Session           |
| 2      | Login App                          |
| 3      | Create/Use/Delete Cookie           |
| 4      | Time-Adjusted Session              |
| 5      | Deploy Array in Cookie and Session |

#### 1. Start/Use/Delete Session
before beginning, we need to start session but in index page. after than assign in a session value. Possible to destroy all session or selected session.

#### 2. Login App
easy to use session login app and also redirect by header() function after login.

#### 3. Create/Use/Delete Cookie
we should use function to create cookie and can use like a session value but delete of cookie is so weird..

#### 4. Time-Adjusted Session
Maybe depend my localhost but it didn't work to me. Anyway, i will explain.

Keep time in session while make login operations and check time() every time and if passed, destroy all of sessions

#### 5. Deploy Array in Cookie and Session
so simple for session, assign an array value and that's it. first params should be array and index is name of value. I know cookie is weird in PHP.

### 11. File Upload

| Number | Subject                  |
| ---    | ---                      |
| 1      | Form Example             |
| 2      | Get File Info by $_FILES |
| 3      | Upload File              |
| 4      | Convert to the Function  |
| 5      | Upload Multiple Files    |

#### 1. Form Example
Simple upload form. input should be file and put enctype in form tag

#### 2. Get File Info by $_FILES
Catching file data by $_FILES value error return 4 means file not uploaded

#### 3. Upload File
-

#### 4. Convert to the Function
-

#### 5. Upload Multiple Files
-
